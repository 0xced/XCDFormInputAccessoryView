About
=====
`XCDFormInputAccessoryView` is a view to be used above the keyboard with *previous*, *next* and *done* buttons for navigating text fields.

`XCDFormInputAccessoryView` uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and must be built with Xcode 4.5 or greater. It has been tested on iOS 4, 5 and 6.

Usage
=====
In your `UIViewController` subclass, redeclare the `inputAccessoryView` property and create a new instance of `XCDFormInputAccessoryView`, for example in your `viewDidLoad` method:

	#import "XCDFormInputAccessoryView.h"
	
	@interface MyViewController ()
	@property (nonatomic, strong) XCDFormInputAccessoryView *inputAccessoryView;
	@end
	
	@implementation MyViewController
	- (void) viewDidLoad
	{
		[super viewDidLoad];
		self.inputAccessoryView = [XCDFormInputAccessoryView new];
	}
	@end

If you want to have total control over what the **Previous** and **Next** buttons do, you should initialize `XCDFormInputAccessoryView` with the `initWithResponders:` method instead and pass an array of `UIResponder` instances. If you do not supply an array of responders, then `XCDFormInputAccessoryView` uses the following heuristic to find which text input views will be used:

1. Find all text fields and editable text views in the key window
2. Sort them using their frame origin vertical position
